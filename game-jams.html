                These are the games from game jams I've participated in. My goal when making them was to incorporate interesting ideas and to get better at the game development process. In Jester Jam, I used rotoscoping for the animation to give it a smoother and more unique feel. In Stuck Together, I combined 2D and 3D gameplay to challenge myself to code something more complex. Both games were made from scratch entirely using Lua.
